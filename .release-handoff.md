### 🔁 Pre-Release Sanity Checklist

#### 🧹 1. Finalize all changes

- [ ] Code is complete and passing tests
- [ ] `package.json` scripts updated
- [ ] Workflows (`.github/workflows/`) finalized
- [ ] Docs and coverage generated (`npm run docs`)

#### 🗂️ 2. Stage & commit all changes

> This ensures changes show up in the changelog

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare release [descriptive tag]"
```

Example:

```bash
chore: prepare release with updated CI and typedoc targets
```

#### 🧪 3. Run tests one last time

```bash
npm run coverage
```

✅ Pass = proceed  
❌ Fail = stop, fix, commit

#### 🔖 4. Run the release process

Choose one:

```bash
npm run release          # auto determine version
npm run release:patch    # for bugfix
npm run release:minor    # for features
npm run release:major    # for breaking changes
```

#### 📝 5. Check the results

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` looks good
- [ ] `package.json` has correct version
- [ ] Git tag was created (use `git tag` to check)

#### 💾 6. Commit & Push

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

---

### 📦 Optional: Publish to npm

When ready:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

---

### 🔁 Releasing Again?

Bump new features or fixes, then repeat the checklist.

## 🧠 Pro Tip

If something goes wrong:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

...undoes the last release commit (version + changelog) without destroying your changes.
